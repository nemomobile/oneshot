# This adds oneshot job to be run later or now
# usage: add-oneshot [--now] [--user] <name of the job> [<more job names>]
# If --now is given, job is run immediately instead of postponing it later
# if instant run fails or if --now is not given, the link is created for later run
# If --user is given, job is run as user, otherwise as root
# Job name is given as name of the executable located in /usr/lib/oneshot.d
# ie. no path mentioned
